# Binary-Logistic-Regression
This project uses the Iris Dataset and applies Binary Logistic Regression to predict species classification based on different features of the flowers (like petal length, petal width, sepal length, and sepal width). The goal is to build a machine learning model using scikit-learn to predict the class of the iris species.
