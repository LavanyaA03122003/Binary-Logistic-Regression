# Binary-Logistic-Regression
This project uses the Iris Dataset and applies Binary Logistic Regression to predict species classification based on different features of the flowers (like petal length, petal width, sepal length, and sepal width). The goal is to build a machine learning model using scikit-learn to predict the class of the iris species.

üéØ Objective
The aim of this project is to develop a binary classification machine learning model that accurately predicts whether a flower belongs to one of two iris species. The dataset is split into training and test sets, and model performance is evaluated using accuracy metrics.

üß† Approach
1. Preprocessed and explored the Iris dataset.
2. Selected two flower species for binary classification.
3. Applied Binary Logistic Regression from Scikit-learn.
4. Evaluated the model on unseen test data using accuracy score.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Libraries Used
1. NumPy	For numerical operations and efficient data handling
2. Pandas	Used for structured data manipulation and analysis
3. Scikit-learn	Machine learning model creation and evaluation
4. train_test_split	To partition the dataset into training and test sets
5. LogisticRegression	To build the binary logistic regression classifier
6. load_iris	To import the Iris dataset from Scikit-learn
7. accuracy_score	For assessing the predictive accuracy of the model
8. jupyter notebook and python
   
‚úÖ Outcome
The logistic regression model was successfully trained and tested on the dataset. The model achieved high accuracy in distinguishing between the two selected species, demonstrating the effectiveness of binary classification on structured datasets.
